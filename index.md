Hi, I'm Jondall and this is my website.

I am an aspiring ocean professional with an interest in physical oceanography in polar regions. I am currently employed as a hydrographic surveyor out of Connecticut, working on projects up and down the east coast. 

My passions include diners, cold weather, arts and crafts, and listening to music.
